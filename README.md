## ðŸ˜‹ Introduction

It's my own linter tools config setup, still 'in develop'. 

## ðŸ˜„ Say Hi

â€‹	My experience: although I used eslint and prettier many times but I did not remember to create a sharable config, so I always need to setup them every time, it's really cumbersome and even made me not want to use eslint and prettier. 

â€‹	One day I wake up and made this repo and publish them as npm module, now I can easily setup them, so happy. (PS: this repo will include all my config files not only eslint and prettier). I update this repo according to my dev road. 

â€‹	**Reminid: ** This repo is just for personal use, if someone want to use it (happy), you'd better create your own rules (but I think this repo can help you learn how to create a sharable eslint/prettier config)

## ðŸ˜€ Usage 

1. `yarn add --dev eslint prettier typescript eslint-config-xhmm prettier-config-xhmm`

2. create `.eslintrc`ï¼š

   for nodejs

   ```json
   {
     "extends": ["xhmm/ts-node"]
   }
   ```

   or for vanilla browser dev

   ```json
   {
     "extends": ["xhmm/ts-browser"]
   }
   ```

   or for [typescript react](<https://github.com/XHMM/typescript-react-starter>)

   ```json
   {
     "extends": ["xhmm/ts-react"]
   }
   ```

3. create `prettier.config.js`ï¼š

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     ...require('prettier-config-xhmm')
   };
   ```

4. edit `tsconfig.json`(below means let tsc deal but not eslint because tsc is more efficient)ï¼š

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "noUnusedLocals": true,
       "noUnusedParameters": true
     }
   }
   ```

5. you need to have a `tsconfig.json` file for some rules to work, by default, it will search `tsconfig.json` in the same level with node_modules, if you want to change it, change your `.eslintrc` as below :

   ```json
       {
         "extends": ["xhmm/ts-xx"],
         "parserOptions": {
           "project": "./src/tsconfig.json"
         }
       }
   ```

6. create a `.editconfig` file :

   ```text
   root = true
   [*]
   indent_style = space
   indent_size = 2
   end_of_line = lf
   charset = utf-8
   trim_trailing_whitespace = false
   insert_final_newline = true
   ```

7. if using `xhmm/ts-browser` or `xhmm/ts-react`, go on creating `.browserslistrc` and configure your target browsers ([examples](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#full-list))

8. (optional) stylelint setup: it's pretty simple (I am not very focus on this linter(because webstorm support is bad?))ï¼š

   - `yarn add --dev stylelint stylelint-config-standard`

   - create `.stylelintrc`ï¼š

     ```json
     {
       "extends": "stylelint-config-standard"
     }
     ```

9. (optional) create `.eslintignore` and `.stylelintignore` to ignore not related files. (remind: ignorefiles should be placed in root dir) 

------



ðŸ˜œ That's all, after setup, every prettier format problem will become an eslint error (although it's very annoying, I want to force myself have a good habit of writing clean code, when I got it, I will turn off prettier related rules), you can checkout other rules from source config files, happy confident coding!
